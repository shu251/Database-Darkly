    "text": "Alveolata (or Alveolates) contains well-known groups of protists: Apicomplexa, Ciliophora, and Dinoflagellata. Grouped with Stramenopiles and Rhizaria, the three clades also form what is known as the SAR supergroup. Alveolata share the presence of membrane-enclosed sacs, or vesicles, just beneath the cell membrane. In Dinoflagellata (dinoflagellates), these sacs can contain plates, forming a sort of armor. The sacs ensure a thick yet flexible cell wall in naked cells. Alveolata also share tubulocristate mitochondria, characteristic of the SAR group. Alveolata are ubiquitous in deep-sea environments and often make up the most diverse group present. For instance, MArine ALveolates (or MALV) is an order of parasitic dinoflagellates that are frequently found in deep-sea samples.\n\n\nThe Phylum Dinoflagellata contains around 2,400 living species and even more fossilized species. Dinoflagellates are biflagellated, possessing a transverse and longitudinal flagellum which differ functionally and morphologically, and have retained alveoli. They vary in form and function, being thecate or athecate, but generally pear-shaped, photosynthetic or non-photosynthetic, and free-living or parasitic. Dinoflagellates are abundant in both freshwater and marine environments from the equator to the poles, and even in snow and sea ice. They are second, only to diatoms in oceanic primary production with half of the species being photosynthetic. Dinoflagellates employ a variety of trophic strategies including mixotrophy, phagotrophy, osmotrophy, and myzocytosis. Photosynthetic dinoflagellates are typically mixotrophic, involving heterotrophy, as well. Many species are symbiotic as mutualists and parasites. The most notable mutualistic dinoflagellates are zooxanthellae, having relationships with coral and other invertebrates. The order Syndiniales, also known as Marine Alveolates, are parasitic dinoflagellates whose hosts include crustaceans, fish, cnidarians, and protists, including other dinoflagellates. The Marine Aleveolates consist of two groups whose sequences have frequently been obtained in deep-sea eukaryotic diversity studies. There are many toxic species, several of which can form blooms that kill or cause illness to other organisms. The function of the toxins in other dinoflagellates is understudied, as they do not seem to deter predators. Benthic dinoflagellates and their effect on marine ecosystems are greatly understudied, despite their presence being common in sediments. Notable features of dinoflagellates include a circadian rhythm and bioluminescence in some species.\n\n\n\nThe Phylum Ciliophora is a large group of protists, almost all of which are free-living heterotrophs. Ciliates are distinguished by three key traits: a ciliated cell surface, at some stage of life; nuclear dimorphism, the presence of two morphologically and functionally distinct nuclei, the macronucleus and micronucleus; and conjugation, a sexual process in which compatible mates temporarily fuse to exchange genetic material of the micronuclei. The eponymous cilia are typically used for locomotion and feeding, the modes of which are relatively diverse. Ciliates feed upon bacteria, smaller protists, such as algae, and other ciliates. Some ciliates retain ingested bacteria, such as methane and hydrogen sulfide-utilizing bacteria, which continue to function, providing nutrients and space for continued growth and production. This extends to the chloroplasts of ingested algae which can be retained rather than digested, enabling primary production in the ciliate, a process referred to as kleptoplasty. Ciliates can also be symbionts in other organisms, such as ruminal ciliates which aid in the digestion processes of their hosts. There are over 8,000 species of ciliates, distributed globally, in a wide variety of environments, occupying an important trophic level in these ecosystems.\n\n\n\nApicomplexans are a large phylum of unicellular, parasitic protists that range from a symmetrical round to an elongated shape. They utilize myzocytotic ingestion, also known as ‘cellular vampirism’, in which they pierce the cell membrane of their prey with a feeding tube and proceed to suck out the contents and digest them. This is a method of passive ambush feeding, where they wait for prey and then secure them through the use of a quick ambush.\nThrough their parasitism, apicomplexans can pose a great risk to the health of the host organism. They are able to conduct these parasitic invasions through the use of a collection of organelles termed the apical complex. These organelles, particularly rhoptries and micronemes, are what gives them the ability to adhere to host cells, subsequently invade the host cells, and establish a parasitophorous vacuole, which is what surrounds the parasite and protects it from the host’s cellular defenses.\nThe most interesting feature of the apicomplexans is their possession of an apicoplast, a relict photosynthetic plastid that is only found in this phylum. While the plastids found in photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and algae, are largely known for their green appearance and being the location of photosynthesis, they do not possess either of those traits as they exist in apicomplexans. These organelles are essential to apicomplexan’s survival, as without them the organism would perish.\n\n\n\nThe Perkinsea phylum is a group of protists consisting of the marine genera Perkinsus and Parvilucifera and the freshwater genera Phagodinium and Rastrimonas. This phylum is mainly parasitic and is the closest sister group to dinoflagellates. These parasitic marine protists have been frequently detected to thrive in the sediments and seawater of hydrothermal vents and have been thought to negatively affect the community structure and population of the organisms inhabiting these sites. Perkinsids largely infect bivalves, with the exception of the genus Parvilucifera which infects other dinoflagellates. Because of this, perkinsid infestation has devastated the aquaculture of mollusks and has the potential to cause harmful algal blooms.\nThese protists have a naked cell cover, a round shape, and an attached motility. They also have a spherical symmetry, are heteropolar, and are ectosymbiontic. Except for Parvilucifera, which has a bilateral symmetry and is endosymbiontic. Perkinsids are also, on average, passive ambush feeders with myzocytotic ingestion. Perkinsids possess the “archetype” apical complex and utilize it for the invasion of their host. In perkinsids, this apical complex extends from the flagellar apparatus and consists of an open-sided conoid and diverse vesicular components (such as micronemes). After a successful invasion, Perkinsus marinus develops a trophozoite with a spherical nucleus and a vacuole that occupies the majority of the cytoplasm space. The trophozoite then undergoes palintomy in the vegetative state, wrestling in the schizont containing 4-64 immature trophozoites. After rupturing of the schizont’s cell wall, the immature trophozoites spread throughout the host cell body and asexual proliferation continues. As the host dies and the tissue becomes anoxic, the trophozoite enlarges and becomes a pre-zoosporangium (hypnospore) with a thicker cell wall. However, in marine environments, the pre-zoosporangium develops into a zoosporangium with a discharge tube. The zoosporangium undergoes palintomy, producing numerous biflagellated zoospores, which may serve as an infective stage. Alternatively, after Parvilucifera sporangia’s successful invasion, they will grow within the cytoplasm until they occupy nearly the entire host cell. Once mature, a germ tube then forms and releases zoospores.\nThe Perkinsea phylum and its relation to dinoflagellates and apicomplexans is extremely important for our understanding of early evolution. However, there is not enough research on perkinsids for this evolution to be fully understood. Recent data suggests that this phylum is much more diverse than previously thought and further investigation could reveal critical information regarding the connection of lineages."

Alternatively, after Parvilucifera sporangia’s successful invasion, they will grow within the cytoplasm until they occupy nearly the entire host cell. Once mature, a germ tube then forms and releases zoospores.\nThe Perkinsea phylum and its relation to dinoflagellates and apicomplexans is extremely important for our understanding of early evolution. However, there is not enough research on perkinsids for this evolution to be fully understood. Recent data suggests that this phylum is much more diverse than previously thought and further investigation could reveal critical information regarding the connection of lineages."

    "text": "2.1 Phylum: Conosa\nConosa is one of the phyla included in the Amoebozoa supergroup. They exist in a wide range of habitats, from aquatic to terrestrial, and can even survive in anoxic soil environments. The majority of this phylum have a naked cell cover, are phagotrophic, and utilize an ambush feeding tactic. An amoeboid shape is common, and they have a motility style ranging from gliding to swimming or floating. Conosa can be identified morphologically by a monolayer of microtubules that either partially or completely surround the anterior basal body. This can then either diverge towards the nucleus and cell posterior as a half or three-quarters open cone (as seen in Variosea and Mycetozoa) or as a complete cone (as seen in Archaemoebae). The flagellar apparatus is an ancestral trait and has been evolutionally changed to suit the needs of different lineages. For example, for Pelobiontida, the posterior flagellum and associated cytoskeleton have been lost and for Entamoebidae the whole flagellar apparatus has been lost."
